.SH DESCRIPTION
Campagnol is a distributed IP-based VPN software able to open new connections 
through NATs or firewalls without any configuration. It uses UDP for the
transport layer and utilizes tunneling and encryption (with DTLS).
.LP
This software is the rendezvous server of the VPN. It is used to register each
participant of the VPN and is needed for the UDP hole punching. It regularly
exchanges keepalive messages with each registered clients in order to maintain
the contexts of the connections in the involved NATs and firewalls.
.LP
The server opens a UDP socket to communicate with the clients. The default port
is \fI57888\fR.

This version has a small GUI that can be used to monitor the registered clients

v 0.3.2:
	client:
	Read the DTLS data (keys, certificates) only once at startup.

	Support rate limiting for the whole client and per connection.
	Give the PID file in argument instead of in the config file.
	OpenBSD port.
	Add an option to force the local address sent to the RDV (it may be
	usefull with multiple layers of NAT).
	Send keepalive messages on the connections. Add an option to control
	the interval between keepalive messages.
	Man page for the configuration file.

	rdv server:
	Add an option to set the maximum number of registered clients.

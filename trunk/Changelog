v 0.3.4	
	Add support for NetBSD.

	client:
	* MTU: Make sure that the packet size is coherent with the MTU during
	the handshake.
	* DTLS: Fix the handling of the receiving timeout. The required
	version of OpenSSL is now 0.9.8m.
	* cygwin: The inteface parameter in the configuration file can now be used
	with an interface name as specified in Network Connections. 

v 0.3.3
	The client and rdv server have been ported to Cygwin.
	Add a texinfo manual.

	client:
	* bss_fifo: add a drop-tail mode in addition to the default blocking
	write.
	* communication, dtls_utils, peer: New design. Connections are now
	handled by a new thread from creation to shutdown. This is less tricky
	but cost the creation of a new thread as soon as a connection is
	asked.
	* configure.ac: Update the required version of OpenSSL to >=0.9.8j in
	order to have a decent DTLS implementation.
	* MTU: Allow the receiving of packets larger than the VPN MTU.
	* configure.ac: Add some optional warnings (with --enable-warnings)
	and a macro to check the CFLAGS.
	* communication: Fix some potential packet loss when the client
	re-registers with the RDV. The connection with the RDV server is now
	handled in a dedicated thread.
	* net_socket.c: Check the length of the interface name.
	* ca_wrap.sh: Add a command to list the generated certificates.
	* campagnol.c: Add a command line option to mlock the process.
	* configuration.c: Reduce the default size of the queues from 50
	packets to 20.
	* configuration: Replace the parser with a more readable and
	maintainable parser. The new parser supports parameters with multiple
	values and preserves the order of the definitions. The [UP] and [DOWN]
	sections have been replaced with a single [COMMANDS] section.
	* daemon: --verbose and --debug are now also used with --daemon to
	adjust the log verbosity.
	* tun_device: fix the local UDP port in the up and down commands.

	rdv server:
	* configuration: Set the default maximum number of clients to 100.
	* daemon: --verbose and --debug are now also used with --daemon to
	adjust the log verbosity.

v 0.3.2:
	client:
	Read the DTLS data (key and certificates) only once at startup.
	Add an option to give a directory with the root certificates (instead of
	giving a certificate chain file).
	Add the possibility to define which commands are run when the TUN
	device is opened or closed.
	The configuration files now accepts line continuation.
	Better CRL handling. Possibility to reload the CRL/key/certificate on
	signals.
	Correct the bad handling of timed-out connections or failed hole
	punching.
	Finer locking granularity.
	Linux: add options to set the TUN/TAP device TX queue.

	rdv server:
	Replace the java implementation by a new one in C.

v 0.3.1:
	client:
	Support rate limiting for the whole client and per connection.
	Give the PID file in argument instead of in the config file.
	OpenBSD port.
	Add an option to force the local address sent to the RDV (it may be
	usefull with multiple layers of NAT).
	Send keepalive messages on the connections. Add an option to control
	the interval between keepalive messages.
	Man page for the configuration file.

	rdv server:
	Add an option to set the maximum number of registered clients.
	Regularly clean dead clients and try to reduce memory consumption.
	Add a Makefile to ease building and installing.
	Man page.

v 0.3:
	client:
	Now using the autotools.
	FreeBSD port. Various cleanings in order to prepare the FreeBSD port and
	more robust code.
	New and faster SSL queues.
	Configuration: new INI-like format with a less buggy file parser. Now
	use a default configuration file (/etc/campagnol.conf).
	Better checking of loopback interfaces when searching the local
	IP and use getifaddrs when available.
	Fix some memory leaks with pthreads and OpenSSL.
	Write the PID into /var/run/campagnol.pid or another location.
	Add a receiving timeout so that openssl can detect a packet loss
	during a handshake and resend.
	Add the possibility to send the local IP and port to the RDV server.

	rdv server:
	Move the file into the net.sourceforge.campagnol package.
	Small cleanings.
	Better ANT build file.
	When two peers are behind the same NAT and their local addresses are
	kown, use the local adresses intead of the public addresses.

v 0.2:
	client: use syslog to log important messages when the client is
	started as a daemon. Add sample configuration files and certificates.
	A few bugfixes, most of them being unlikely to happen. Enhanced
	Makefile.
	rdv server: adjust the behavior of the verbose and debug parameters.

v 0.1:
	First release.

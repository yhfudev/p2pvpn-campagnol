.SH NAME
campagnol - Decentralized VPN over UDP tunneling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B campagnol
.RB [ \-vDdhV ]...
.RI [ configuration_file ]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Campagnol is a distributed IP-based VPN software able to open new connections 
through NATs or firewalls without any configuration. It uses UDP for the
transport layer and utilizes tunneling and encryption (with DTLS).
.LP
This software is the client part of the VPN, i.e. the software that will
send/receive the packets on the VPN after authentication and encryption. This
program is non-interactive and can run as a daemon.
.LP
Campagnol starts off with registering with the rendezvous (RDV) server which
keeps track of every clients of the VPN. It will then regularly exchange some
small messages with the RDV server in order to keep the connection alive and
maintain the translation tables of the NATs. Later on the RDV server is used to
initiate the UDP hole punching between two clients.
.LP
Campagnol uses the TUN kernel driver to create a virtual network interface for
the VPN and then associates a route to this interface. When a packet for a
unknown peer arrives on the TUN device, Campagnol asks the RDV server for a new
connection. This initiate the UDP hole punching between the two peers. Once the
connection is established, the two peers open a DTLS session, authenticate each
other and eventually the link is ready. This is a peer to peer connection: no
data will flow through the RDV server or any other node. After some time of
inactivity (or if one of the peer exits) the session will be closed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-v" ", " "--verbose"
verbose mode
.TP
.BR "\-D" ", " "--daemon"
start the client in background (daemonize) and create a PID file in
.I @localstatedir@/run/campagnol.pid
or in another file defined in the configuration
.TP
.BR "\-d" ", " "--debug"
debug mode
.TP
.BR "\-h" ", " "--help"
print help, then exit
.TP
.BR "\-V" ", " "--version"
show version information and exit
.SH AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
The communications between two peers are opened when needed and are fully
authenticated and encrypted thanks to DTLS.
.LP
Campagnol uses an X.509 certificate based security. Each client needs to
own a valid certificate and its associated key pair. Therefore a typical
usage is to have a minimum PKI to manage the VPN. You will for instance
generate:
.LP
.RS
\[bu] a private key (your CA) and an associated trusted root certificate
distributed to all the clients

\[bu] one private key and one signed certificate per client

\[bu] possibly a certificate revocation list to manage the old client's
certificates

.LP
The cipher list used by OpenSSL can be defined in the configuration file. By
default Campagnol uses OpenSSL's default algorithms. You can use the
.B ciphers
command from OpenSSL to see the available algorithms:
.LP
.RS
.nf
$ openssl ciphers -v -tls1 DEFAULT
.fi
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file has an INI-like syntax. Comments start with a `;' or a
`#' and continue to the end of the line. Values may be quoted between double
quotation marks ("...") and special characters can be escaped with `\\'
(\\\\, \\n, \\# ...). The white-spaces around the section names, the parameters 
and the values are stripped.
All names are case sensitive.
.LP
Values can reference other values from the same section using the syntax
.RI ${ param }: 
.LP
.RS
.nf

About
-----

This directory contains samples configuration files and X.509
certificates. The certificates are intended for testing purpose
only. Those files allow you to quickly test Campagnol and see if the
UDP hole punching is working with your NAT/firewall.

You will have to edit the configurations file at least to change the
"server_host" configuration variable with your rendezvous server
host.

The two configuration files use relative path for the keys and
certificates. So you have to run the client from this directory unless
you change the paths.

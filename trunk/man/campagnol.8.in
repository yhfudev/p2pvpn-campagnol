.SH NAME
campagnol - Decentralized VPN over UDP tunneling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B campagnol
.RB [ \-dDhmvV ]
.RB [ "-p \fIpidfile\fR" ]
.RI [ configuration_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Campagnol is a distributed IP-based VPN software able to open new connections 
through NATs or firewalls without any configuration. It uses UDP for the
transport layer and utilizes tunneling and encryption (with DTLS).
.LP
This software is the client part of the VPN, i.e. the software that will
send/receive the packets on the VPN after authentication and encryption. This
program is non-interactive and can run as a daemon.
.LP
Campagnol starts off with registering with the rendezvous (RDV) server which
keeps track of every clients of the VPN. It will then regularly exchange some
small messages with the RDV server in order to keep the connection alive and
maintain the translation tables of the NATs. Later on the RDV server is used to
initiate the UDP hole punching between two clients.
.LP
Campagnol uses the TUN kernel driver to create a virtual network interface for
the VPN and then associates a route to this interface. When a packet for a
unknown peer arrives on the TUN device, Campagnol asks the RDV server for a new
connection. This initiate the UDP hole punching between the two peers. Once the
connection is established, the two peers open a DTLS session, authenticate each
other and eventually the link is ready. This is a peer to peer connection: no
data will flow through the RDV server or any other node. After some time of
inactivity (or if one of the peer exits) the session will be closed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-d" ", " "--debug"
debug mode
.TP
.BR "\-D" ", " "--daemon"
start the client in background (daemonize) and create a PID file in
.I \*[pidfilename]
or in another file defined with
.I --pidfile
.TP
.BR "\-h" ", " "--help"
print help, then exit
.TP
.BR "\-m" ", " "--mlock"
lock the process's pages into RAM by calling the mlockall system call if
available
.TP
.BR "\-p" ", " "--pidfile" "=\fIpidfile\fR"
write the pid into
.I pidfile
when running in background
.TP
.BR "\-v" ", " "--verbose"
verbose mode
.TP
.BR "\-V" ", " "--version"
show version information and exit
.SH AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
The communications between two peers are opened when needed and are fully
authenticated and encrypted thanks to DTLS.
.LP
Campagnol uses an X.509 certificate based security. Each client needs to
own a valid certificate and its associated key pair. Therefore a typical
usage is to have a minimum PKI to manage the VPN. You will for instance
generate:
.LP
.RS
\[bu] a private key (your CA) and an associated trusted root certificate
distributed to all the clients

\[bu] one private key and one signed certificate per client

\[bu] possibly a certificate revocation list to manage the old client's
certificates
.RE
.LP
The cipher list used by OpenSSL can be defined in the configuration file. By
default Campagnol uses OpenSSL's default algorithms. You can use the
.B ciphers
command from OpenSSL to see the available algorithms:
.LP
.RS
.nf
$ openssl ciphers -v -tls1 DEFAULT
.fi
.RE
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGINT ", " SIGQUIT " and " SIGTERM
Campagnol will close all connections and quit.
.TP
.BR SIGUSR1
will cause Campagnol to close all connections, disconnect from the RDV server,
reread the key, the certificates and the CRL, and restart. The configuration
file is not reread.
.TP
.BR SIGUSR2
will cause Campagnol to reread the key, the certificates and the CRL. The new
files will be used for the subsequent connections. It's especially useful to
load a new CRL.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Campagnol needs a configuration file. It will use by default
.I \*[configname]
but you can specify another file as a command line argument.
.PP
The syntax of this file and all the available options are described in 
.BR campagnol.conf (5).
.PP
You can use the sample configuration file as a basis for writing your own.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I \*[configname]
The default configuration file used if none is given on the command line.

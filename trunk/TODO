Known issues
------------
- Client do not handle the loss of DLTS shutdown packets.


Plans
-----
- Rewrite the rendezvous server in C.
- Use DTLS between the rendezvous server and the peers, except for the ping messages.
- Possibility to define the common options in the rendezvous server and to distribute them to the peers.
- Maybe use OCSP instead of a CRL which has to be distributed and maintained for every clients.
- OpenBSD port, maybe solaris too.

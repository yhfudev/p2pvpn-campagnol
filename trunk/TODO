Known issues
------------
- Client do not handle the loss of DLTS shutdown packets.


Plans
-----
- Try to cope with the loss of important DTLS datagrams.
- Rewrite the rendezvous server in C, which would allow to use DLTS
  between the peers and the server. Or wait for a good and flexible Java
  DTLS implementation.

Known issues
------------
- When trying to open a session between two peers, one using a revoked
  certificate, both peers will eventually crash.
- Client do not handle the loss of DLTS shutdown packets.


Plans
-----
- Program and source code translation.
- Rewrite the rendezvous server in C, which would allow to use DLTS
  between the peers and the server. Or wait for a good and flexible Java
  DTLS implementation.

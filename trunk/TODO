Known issues
------------
- Clients do not handle the loss of DLTS shutdown packets.


Plans
-----
- Use DTLS between the rendezvous server and the peers, except for the ping messages.
- Possibility to define the common options in the rendezvous server and to distribute them to the peers.
- Maybe use OCSP instead of a CRL which has to be distributed to and maintained by every clients.
- Solaris port
- UPnP ?
- Relay connections trough the RDV server ? And load sharing ?
- IPv6 support
